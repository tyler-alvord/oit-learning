<!-- 
Check this out! If you just add a hyphen and don't surround the following text with square brackets, it will just show as an unlinked item in the side bar!
The code below will create "Image Information" and "Openstack Information" as sort of 'category headers' - they will not have a linked page that can be visited. 
To add 'child pages' to any page (linked or unlinked) just add a tab before the hyphen and format them like usual.

<!--
Another fun thing about this document is that it doesn't *have* to include all the pages that you've created. You can hide pages from users that don't know the URL slug by omitting them from this list
EXAMPLE:
- [Template Page](template.md "This is a template page")
^^^
This isn't going to show in the sidebar because it's a comment, but if you uncomment that, the page will show. If you leave it commented, you can still access it by manually navigating to the /template page
