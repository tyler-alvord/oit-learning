# Welcome to the OIT Student Openstack Documentation!

In this site, you'll find documentation on how to make the most out of the openstack system installed at the OIT Willsonville campus. 

>Before you dive in, **please read the OIT Student Rules of Engagement!**<!--Should find the link for this-->

## Here's a little FAQ that I've put together to help you get started with this! <!--{docsify-ignore}-->

### Okay, what the heck is openstack?
Openstack is an awesome, open-source cloud soultion. It's commonly used to make private cloud environments and datacenters more closely match the functionality of the public cloud. The installed version that you'll find here is capable of running instances of images (think Amazon EC2, or Google Compute), provisioning block and object storage (think Amazon EBS/Google Persistent Disk), and virtual networking (VPC). This allows you to tinker with some of the awesome benefits of a cloud solution, without the need to purchase a plan, worry about going over your limits, or any of the other headaches that can be associated with working in the cloud. 

The really neat part is, you can access this right here on campus - as in you could literally touch this server. Seriously! It's probably in the student lab right now! (Probably don't just go touching it though :grin: )

### What can you use this for?
This system will hopefully allow you to rapidly provision images that can be useful for learning inside and outside of your normal class. Things like server instances, random VM's, a database or two - really just about anything that you need!

There are also a good number of pre-built images available for you to provision! You can learn more about those in the **"Image Information"** section of this manual (check out the sidebar to get there). You'll find descriptions of all the images, how to login and use them, and any little details that will make using the image easier for you!

There are a couple of different types of pre-built images that you need to know about. Some of these computer systems are considered sensitive and should not be allowed to connect to the internet. **Use of these systems are subject the terms of the OIT Rules of Engagement**, and also - just like... common deceny... don't be rude... please? This system is a privilege for all and misuse of it could interfere with its efficacy to help everyone.

### Cool, how do I get started? 
There are a couple of administrators that you can chat with to get an account setup. Check in with Dan, or take a look at the admin list for this Git Repo to find out which students you can chat with. 

### I have an account, now how do I access this system?
Good Question! Once you have your login created for the system, you can hit the login page at lab.connection.ninja <!--Just need to add the actual hostname for this one-->

### How do I do _____? 
Openstack has a lot to wrap your head around. But, good news! The main things that you'll need to know are going to be found in the **"Openstack Information"** section of this manual :tada:. Give it a look! It should tell you everything you need to know from creating images to get added to the system, setting up instances, your permissions, networking - really all the good stuff you could ever want to know. 

This should really just be used as a way to dip your toes into the environment. There is an absolute ***ton*** of information available out there, so do a little searching and see what all is available to you!

### This is neat! Can I be an admin? 
Maybe! If you find yourself really enjoying this environment and you want to tinker more with the guts of Openstack, you might be well-suited to be a student administrator! Check in with Dan for approval! Keep in mind - as Uncle Ben says:  *"with great power, comes some moderate levels of responsibility"* (there's a few expectations of admins for this system).
