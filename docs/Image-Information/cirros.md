# Using the Cirros Image
There is not a whole lot that you can do with the Cirros image. It is a default image that exists within Openstack for testing purposes. It cannot install packages, it cannot run a GUI. Cirros is very useful for very low-resource test instances. Great for testing things like if virtualizing is working properly, if network connectivity is working for your routers and networks, or if you need to interface with a device without the use of Network Address translation to troubleshoot another hosts connectivity.
