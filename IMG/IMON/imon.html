    <h2>DOCUMENT INFORMATION:</h2>
    <p> This document is for the Infection Monkey (imon) image. It will describe the basic features of Infection Monkey, as well as some of the image's maintenance and use cases. </p>
    <!--Briefly describe what this document is - NOT what the system or configuration is. -->
    <!--Ex: "This is a document describing the configuration and maintenance of the IMAGE qcow file."-->
    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p>Infection Monkey is a vulnerability scanner and network attack simulator. It uses one machine (in this case, this image - also known within the software as "monkey island") to propogate access to the network through exploits and attack methods.</p>
    <p>This image should be used after consent to the rules of engagement - using this image for unintended purposes is dangerous, traceable, and in violation of not only the terms of use for this system, but also the terms of service for the application.</p>
    <p>Infection Monkey's native documentation can be accessed in the link here:</p>
