    <h2>Additional Configuration</h2>
    <p>This system is installed on two systems. the first is a controller node. It is currently a virtual machine in Hyper V provisioned with 8GB RAM and 4CPU cores. The controller node is the host for the main components for the system, including Keyston, Glance, Neutron, and Cinder.</p>
    <p>The second computer is configured on a Bare Metal system with 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and Intel Core i7-6700k. This is a compute node that will be used to host most of the virtual machines and will be managed by the control node.</p>
    <p>The IP Address of each server is configured statically in accordance with the environemtn that they are plugged into. A reservation will be made when it is interest in the final environment</p>
    <p>Both the controller and compute nodes will use the same SSH from the Github repository. The SSH key is called "node01-SSH"</p> 
    <p>The primary controller server is not attached to an SSH key due to the ease of remote access through the Hyper V remote desktop implementation.</p>
