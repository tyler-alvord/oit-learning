    <h3>Software updates</h3>
    <p>Software should be somewhat regularly maintained. A simple apt-get upgrade should bring all relevant packages up to date to make sure that patches are applied. </p>
    <h3>General Administrative Tasks</h3>
    <li>Image maintenance</li>
    <li>Documentation maintenance</li>
    <li>New Administrator Enablement</li>
    <p>As students, it's likely that there will need to be handoffs either during busy seasons/times, or after student administrators graduate. Student administrators that know they will be unavailable for the administrative tasks of this system should notify the staff administrator of their absense with enought time to make the necessary adjustments - either selecting a new student administrator, or to notify the staff admin that they will need to keep an eye on the system for a duration.</p>
    <p>Ample student administrators should be kept so that the system can be generally maintained by students without excessive staff involvement. For the initial run of this system, a single student will probably suffice, but this may need to scale up as the system grows or as the administrative tasks become better understood.</p>
