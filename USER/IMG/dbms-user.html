    <h2>What is the MariaDB Image?</h2>
    <p>This image contains a configured version of MariaDB. It will be useful for you when you want to query live data, or if you want to create a database with non-persistant data for testing.</p>
    <h2>How to use the MariaDB Image</h2>
    <p>The system can be accessed directly by logging in with the credentials that are listed below. Alternatively, you can set this up for external access by assigning an external ip address within the network settings in OpenStack</p>
    <h3>Add an external IP address</h3>
    <p>Openstack doesn't allow you to add an external IP addres directly to the host (as in, assigning an IP from the network to a Network Interface Card on the guest). Instead, you can leverage 1:1 Network Address Translation to provide external access to the Guests within Openstack. This feature is called "Floating IP"</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Head to the "Network" tab within the "Project" menu</li>
        <li>Select the "Floating IPs" option from the resulting drop down</li>
        <li>Next to the Allocated floating IP, select "Associate"</li>
        <li>Select the instance that you want to give the IP</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>USERNAME</h2>
    <p>oit</p>
    <h2>Password</h2>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>The DBMS image will contain the default "employees" test database that can be found in the following Git:</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db"></a>
    <p>This will create the following tables and populate it with data:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Table Name</th>
            <th>Record Count</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>employees</td>
            <td>300,024</td>
            <td>Contains all individual Employee records</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>departments</td>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>Contains all individual department records</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>dept_manager</td>
            <td>24</td>
            <td>Associates Department Leads with their Employee record</td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
            <td>dept_emp</td>
            <td>331,603</td>
            <td>Associates Departments with the employees that work in them - Including some users that share multiple departments</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>titles</td>
            <td>443,308</td>
            <td>Contains the current and past titles for each employee</td>
        </tr>            
        <tr>
            <td>salaries</td>
            <td>2,844,047</td>
            <td>Includes past and present salary information for each employee</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <!--specify asterisks for additional notes at the bottom of the page (* for the first note, ** for the second, and so on) to make these stand out as not part of the line that they're on, use the tag <a style="color:red">*</a>-->
    <!--Pro tip : to monospace a single list item in a list of non-monospace items, use a standard list item, but add the formatting with an <a> block -->
