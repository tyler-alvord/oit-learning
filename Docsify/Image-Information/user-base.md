# Using the base Lubuntu Image

## What is the "Base Image"
|||
|-|-|
| ![](../img/lubuntu-logo.png ':no-zoom') |The base image is a default configuration of Lubuntu (Ubuntu w/ LXQT, or lightweight Ubuntu). It can be used when you just need a quick Linux box to spin up. The QCOW file can be used to create empty instances. |

For more information about creating custom images, speak with a system administrator - you can find the contact details for the admins in the "contacts" page.

## How to use the base image
The base image can be used for whatever you need. It only exists for ease of access and to more easily enable students to make images of their own. Recovery is simple, as it just involves running through the installation process for Lubuntu LTS
