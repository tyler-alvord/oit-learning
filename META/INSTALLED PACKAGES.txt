INSTALLED PACKAGES
============================
NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS MANUALLY UPDATED. ANY NEW PACKAGES INSTALLED ON THE HOST SYSTEM SHOULD BE NOTED HERE

The controller system has the GUI installed for Ubuntu server. The compute node is not configured with a graphic interface. 

TEMPLATE
---------------
Function:
    Briefly describe what this installation actually does for the system.
Configurations:
    How did you change this setup away from it's default configuration
Notes:
    add any notes - storage locations, credentials that you created, caveats or misc. ideas that you'd like to be associated with this configuration

Microstack
---------------
Function:  
    This system is the foundation of all the functions of the test environment system. Microstack includes the user authentication infrastructure, container management, management web portal, storage management, and imaging services. The internal components of this configuration will be noted in the notes section of this entry.
Configuraitons:
    Blueprint configurations
Notes:
    NOVA: This is the compute services that are included with openstack. This service is used to run the environments that are built out for student testing. 
    CINDER: This is the block storage system that can be used to create and manage storage for the images to connect to as their local hard drive
    GLANCE: Glance is the service that's used to image devices. This provides an API to load and unload images from the system. 
    NEUTRON: Provides local networking within the virtual environments on the system. 
    KEYSTONE: The identity platform that provides access control for the web interface and all the other components within the Microstack environment. 
    HORIZON: The web interface for managing the systems. 

Juju
---------------
Function:
    Provides a simple, non-integrated version of kubernetes for the server to host applications. Non-integrated indicates that the system operates separately from the openstack environment, despite openstack having valid kubernetes support, MiniKube is installed separately because microstack doesn't expand with standard openstack packages 
Configurations:
    This is a small part of the overall system. It's going to be in a largely default configuration. 
Notes:
    juju includes a local installation of kubernetes container engine, and the kubectl command line interface for creating and managing containers.
