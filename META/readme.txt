Welcome to the META folder! This folder is intended to contain configuraiton about the OIT-WIL learning environment itself, rather than information about any of the configurations that are stored on the system. 

This folder can be used for documenting the components installed on the main host system, configurations that were applied to the Openstack environment, and any additional about packages that were installed, and anything else needed to maintain and use the administrative environment.
