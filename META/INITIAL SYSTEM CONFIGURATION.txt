INITIAL SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
=================================
KERNEL: 
VERSION: 

USERNAME: oit
PASSWORD: 0wl@dm!n

ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATIONS:
This system is installed on two systems. The first is a controller node. It is currently a virtual machine in hyper v provisioned with 8GB and 4 CPU cores. The controller node is the host for the main components for the sytsem, including Keystone, Glance, Neutron, and Cinder
The second computer is configured on a physical system with 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD, Intel Core i7-6700k. This is a compute node that will be used to host the virtual machines and will be managed by the controlling node. 

The IP Address of each server is configured statically in accordance with the environment that they are plugged into. A reservation will be made when it is installed in the final environment.

The compute node is configured using the ssh key that has been added to the Github that contains this file. "node01-SSH"

The primary controller server is not attached to an SSH key due to the ease of remote access through the Hyper V remote desktop implementation.
